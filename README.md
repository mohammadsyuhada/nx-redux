# NX Redux

**My vision of how NextUI should be.**
Minimal on the surface. Structured underneath. Built to last.

[NextUI](https://github.com/LoveRetro/NextUI) is a custom firmware for retro handheld gaming devices. It replaces the stock operating system with a clean, minimal interface focused on playing retro games with no unnecessary bloat.

## Supported Devices

- **Trimui Brick**
- **Trimui Smart Pro**
- **Trimui Smart Pro S**

## Why Fork?

NextUI is a great foundation — lightweight, focused, and true to its minimalist roots.

But over time I found myself wanting two things the upstream project couldn't give me:

1. **Creative freedom** — the ability to add features and UX improvements without waiting for upstream approval or aligning with someone else's roadmap.
2. **Structural clarity** — cleaner code organization, consistent formatting, and a codebase that's easier to maintain and extend.

NX Redux is where those two goals meet.

## What's Different

Improvements:
- Refactored `nextui.c` from monolithic code to a smaller, focused components
- Various bug fixes and code optimizations across the refactored components
- Added clang-format tooling and code style enforcement, with VSCode support
- Introduced reusable UI components for consistent design across tools
- Fixed incorrect Wi-Fi/Bluetooth state icons in the quick menu
- Added a semi-transparent progress overlay for all blocking actions
- Added confirmation dialogs for actions that require them
- Rewrote the `Settings` app in C with a redesigned UI
- Removed `Battery` monitoring feature. 
- Merged the `LED Control` configurations, `Input`, `Clock` and `Updater` into `Settings` app (no separate app required)
- Integrated the `Remove Loading` feature directly into the install script (no separate app required) 
- Split release builds into per-platform zips (tg5040/tg5050) 

New Features:
- Redesigned UI with consistent styling across the system.
